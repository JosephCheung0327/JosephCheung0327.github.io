        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>I'm Joseph Cheung, a rising sophomore at the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>I will be adding more content to this website soon.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Computer Science
            Specialist and a Statistics Major. I will be working as an IT Intern at Cityline this summer. I'm currently a Web Developer of the <a
                href="https://orionjournal.org/"> Orion Journal</a> and a Content Associate
            of the <a href="https://cssa.sa.utoronto.ca/"> UofT Cybersecurity Student Association</a>. Previously, I
            studied at Po Leung Kuk Ngan Po Ling College and obtained the International
            Baccalaureate (IB) Bilingual Diploma.
        </p>
        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>
              <b>Music &#127925; </b><br>
              Unfortunately, I don't know how to play any musical instruments (Asian failure). I mostly listen to
              East Asian music: J-pop, K-pop, Cantopop, and Mandopop. My favorite artist is Eason Chan.
        </p>
        <p>
              <b>Sports &#127955; </b><br>
              I used to play table tennis and basketball competitively, but I have retired already. I still watch
              table tennis tournaments and the NBA occasionally. I love Stephen Curry and Lin Yun-ju ❤️.
        </p>
        <p>
              <b>Entertainment &#128250; </b><br>
              I'm a big fan of The Simpsons. I also watch very random videos on YouTube, across very different genres. My favorite channels are: Linus
              Tech Tips, MKBHD, Veritasium, Dim Cook Guide, Grian, and of course (not) MAT137.

        <h1>Courses</h1>
        <p>
            This is a list of courses I have taken at UofT and some information about them. I’m aiming to complete a
            CS Specialist and a Statistics Major. I hope this will be useful for future students pursuing similar
            majors. Feel free to contact me if you want more information about these courses. Beware that their
            syllabus and instructors might change every year. Note: I transferred 2.5 credits from IB (unfortunately
            all of them are BR5).
        </p>
        <p>
            The courses are arranged according to their course code, in alphabetical order.

        <h2>Year 1 (2024-2025)</h2>
        <p>
            <b>CSC110: Foundations of Computer Science I </b>(Paul He & Sadia Sharmin)<br>
            BR5, Course Average: A- <br>
            <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/ugdocs/course-outlines/2024/Fall/CSC110Y1F-Fall2024.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a><br>
            This is a well-structured course on the basics of CS and Python. For those who studied CS in high
            school, this course is a great review but some of you might find it boring. For those new to programming,
            this course is paced appropriately, and you have lots of support from the teaching team. This is a
            full-credit course, so there are more lecture hours than other courses. The tests and exam are
            straightforward, so many students get (crazily) amazing scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CSC111: Foundations of Computer Science II </b>(Sadia Sharmin)<br>
            <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/ugdocs/course-outlines/2025/Winter/CSC111H1S-Winter2025.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a><br>
            BR5, Course Average: A- <br>
            This course is slightly harder than CSC110 and has a higher workload. It covers more data structures and sorting algorithms.
            There are two group projects, one being open-ended. Still, the tests and exam are not too difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CDN199: Canada-Hong Kong Migration </b>(Amardeep Kaur)<br>
            BR3, Course Average: B- <br>
            This course explores Hong Kong's migration trends and ties with Canada. There were weekly readings and
            worksheets but the workload was manageable. There were also group discussions every lecture, for around 15
            minutes. This course is great for students interested in Hong Kong and migration trends.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>EAS194: East Asia through Music </b>(Atsuko Sakaki)<br>
            BR1, Course Average: B <br>
            This seminar course explores historic and cultural aspects of East Asian music. There were weekly readings but the workload was appropriate.
            There was an open topic term paper instead of an exam. Participation in online discussions made up a significant portion of the grade.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>EAS289: Environment and East Asia </b>(Yue Meng)<br>
            BR3, Course Average: B <br>
            This course mainly discusses the causes of climate change and possible solutions. The course content
            isn't difficult and the workload is appropriate. However, this course might be boring for those not
            interested in environmental issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MAT137: Calculus with Proofs </b>(Boris Khesin)<br>
            BR5, Course Average: C <br>
            Most of the computations in this course should be familiar to those who studied calculus in high school.
            However, most students might need some time to get used to writing proofs. The problem sets are very difficult, 
            while the tests and exam are not too hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MAT223: Linear Algebra I </b>(Kevin Watmough)<br>
            <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/ebellah/Teaching/2024_25/MAT223Winter25.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a><br>
            BR5, Course Average: C+ <br>
            This is a standard linear algebra course with some proofs. 
            The test and exam are easy as long as you complete WeBWorK assignments and exercises in the course notes.
            There are weekly tutorial quizzes that are quite simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>STA130: An Introduction to Statistical Reasoning and Data Science </b>(Nathalie Moon & Morris
            Greenberg)<br>
            <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/sites/www.statistics.utoronto.ca/files/STA130%20W25_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a><br>
            BR5, Course Average: B <br>
            This course uses R to introduce basic statistical concepts and data science techniques.
            There are weekly assignments and a group project. The test and exam are straightforward if you complete 
            the assignments and attend tutorials.
